# TicTacToe2.0
- This game will allow 3 to 10 players. 
- The board size will be depend on the player count. The dimensions will be playerCount + 1 by playerCount + 1. For example if 3 players want to play, it will be a 4x4 board and if 10 players want to play it will be a 11x11 board.
- The rules and most of the game logic will be similar to classical Tic-Tac-Toe. However, the number of how many pieces a player needs to win will be determined by the user before the game begins. Minimum can be 3 and maximum can be playerCount + 1. For example, a game of four players can be chosen anywhere from 3 - 5 pieces in a row to define the winner. 
- If the entire board is filled and there is no winner, it is a tie.
